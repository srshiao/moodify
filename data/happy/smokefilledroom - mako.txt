Isn't it a little late
Shouldn't you fly away
Little dove with cigarettes
Show 'em that you can hold your breath

I heard about a girl
Buried her dolls and lost her curls
Painted on lipstick red
Grew herself up and then she'd

Walk into a smoke filled room
Oh no one could keep their eyes off you
Have a little drink or two
Oh how could you be that girl I knew

Walk into a smoke filled room
Little black dress and mama's shoes
Isn't it a bit too soon
Oh how could you be that girl I knew

Walk into a smoke filled room
Oh I believe love will follow you
Isn't it a bit too soon
Oh how could you be that girl I knew

Take a step around the room
And every head keeps turning too
Little dove, you fight 'em back
Show em you're so much more than that

I heard about a girl
Buried her dolls and lost her curls
Painted on lipstick red
Grew herself up and then she'd

Walk into a smoke filled room
Oh no one could keep their eyes off you
Have a little drink or two
Oh how could you be that girl I knew

Walk into a smoke filled room
Little black dress and mama's shoes
Isn't it a bit too soon
Oh how could you be that girl I knew
