When the valley couldn't hold me
They throw me in the river
Thinking I would drown
But man ah good swimma
Oh.. OHHH
And when the river didn't drown me 
They throw me in the fire
But the fire jus' cool
I could never burn
Oh.. OHHH

Cuz' I'm a believer 
(I'm a believer)
I'm a believer
(Oh.. Oh)
I'm a believer 
(I'm a believer)
I'm a believer
(Oh.. Oh)

Hold up, pull up

Cuz I'm a.. I'm a

Freetown is my family
(My family)
Whole Carribean follow we
(Carribean follow we)
Evergreen like the forest be
Terrible they can't manage me
Afrika no apology

Cuz I'm a.. I'm a

When the valley couldn't hold me
They throw me in the river
Thinking I would drown
But man ah good swimma
Oh.. OHHH

They say, the hotter the battle
Yea we dance when we conquer
It's been forever
It won't be much longer
Stand firm you will be
Much stronger
Ohh.. OHHH

I'm a believer 
(I'm a believer)
I'm a believer
(Oh.. Oh)
I'm a believer 
(I'm a believer)
I'm a believer
(Oh.. Oh)

Freetown is my family
Rough sea never bother me
Whole Carribean follow we
Root deeper than a forestry
Evergreen like the forest be
Terrible they can't manage me
Afrika no apology

Hold up, pull up

Cuz I'm a.. I'm a

Never fall down yet
Don't digress
Put us against any test
Yea, no stress
Aaaaaright
