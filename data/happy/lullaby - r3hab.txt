Hypnotized, this love out of me
Without your air I can't even breathe
Lead my way out into the light
Sing your lu-lu-lu-lullaby
Cherries in the ashtray
Take me through the day
I just gotta make you drunk in memory
See you at the party
As long as you're with me
Sleeping in my bathtub
But can wish you were late

Keep me safe up in the clouds
'Cause I can't come raining down
Make the most and sleep in the night
Sing your lu-lu-lu-lullaby

Hypnotized, this love out of me
Without your air I can't even breathe
Lead my way out into the light
Sing your lu-lu-lu-lullaby
Cherries in the ashtray
Take me through the day
I just gotta make you drunk in memory
See you at the party
As long as you're with me
Sleeping in my bathtub
But can wish you were late

Keep me safe up in the clouds
'Cause I can't come raining down
Make the most and sleep in the night
Sing your lu-lu-lu-lullaby
