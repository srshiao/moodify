Tell me we don't have to leave
Say we can stay forever
That we can always be
Just me and you together
Cause this moment is all that I want
Woah

Tell me how it used to be
And let me make it better
Cause baby you and me
We'll fly above the weather
Where we're going, there's no holding on
No

Let my eyes be your sunrise here

Standing on top of the world
Hands up in the air feeling so alive
Oh
Screaming at the top of our lungs
To the rhythm of our heartbeat beating tonight
We go
Oooh standing on top of the world <i>[x3]</i>

So this is what it feels like
Living this life in color
Say bye to black and white
You let me change it over
Now I see there's no going back
No

Finally I understand
What feeling's supposed to feel like
And when I got your hand
I've never been so high
All I need is all that you have
Oh

Your eyes are my sunrise here

Standing on top of the world
Hands up in the air feeling so alive
Oh
Screaming at the top of our lungs
To the rhythm of our heartbeat beating tonight
We go
Oooh standing on top of the world <i>[x3]</i>

And from way up here our problem seems so small
So baby have no fear we'll fly above it all

Standing on top of the world
Hands up in the air feeling so alive
Oh
Screaming at the top of our lungs
To the rhythm of our heartbeat beating tonight
We go
Oooh standing on top of the world <i>[x6]</i>
