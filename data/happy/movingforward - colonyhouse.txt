I found life and I found laughter
In forgiveness, I found rest
On the shoulders of redemption
I found hope when hope was dead
I could lose it in a moment
So I dare not close my eyes
I'll watch fear fall with the sunset
And see hope rise with the tide
And when the pain is true
Sometimes these troubles prove that I'm alive

My eyes are open
My heart is beating
My lungs are full
And my body's breathing
I'm moving forward
I found my freedom
I found the life that gave me reason to live

As this dusty road now settles
And I see what lay before
Every tear that held a broken dream
Is now shattered on the floor
And now bursting forth in splendor
Are the blossoms of second tries
Because dreams that bear the mark of love
Are dreams that never die, ooh

Sometimes
Life can feel so unkind
Sorrow won't define me
So just reminds my soul
My soul

My eyes are open
My heart is beating
My lungs are full
And my body's breathing
I'm moving forward
I found my freedom
I know this sorrow
I know the heartache
I know with fear comes a tragic heartbreak
I'm moving forward
I found my freedom
I found a life that gave me reason to love
