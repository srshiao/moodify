You hit me up at 3 A.M. on a Friday night
Say you ain't feelin' right
You need to see my face right now
You ain't over it, just wanna talk a bit

If you wanna talk, let's talk about the way you left me
Left me with a text so cold (yeah)
Even though I'd die to see you
I don't trust myself to meet you
'Cause we both know

That your kiss is a gateway drug
Once you get one, it's never enough
Your kiss is a gateway drug
Once you get one, it's never enough
'Cause

Kissin' leads to
Touchin' leads to
Lovin' leads to
Fuckin' leads to
Someone always seems to get hurt (yeah)
Kissin' leads to
Touchin' leads to
Lovin' leads to
Fuckin' leads to
Everythin' mean nothin'
Your kiss is a gateway drug

You said that you loved me
If you really loved me, why'd you leave me like that
Why'd you go around and talk shit like that
Behind my back, love don't do shit like that, ooh

If you wanna talk, let's talk about the way you left me
Left me with a text so cold (mm)
Even though I'd die to see you
I don't trust myself to meet you
'Cause we both know

That your kiss is a gateway drug
Once you get one, it's never enough
Your kiss is a gateway drug
Once you get one, it's never enough

Touchin' leads to
Lovin' leads to
Fuckin' leads to
Someone always seems to get hurt (yeah)
Kissin' leads to
Touchin' leads to
Lovin' leads to
Fuckin' leads to
Everythin' mean nothin'
Your kiss is a gateway drug
