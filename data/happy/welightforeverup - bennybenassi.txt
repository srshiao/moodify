Look at us fighting, fighting for nothing
We should be striving, striving for something
We're not here for a long time let's make it a good time
Let it go
If we cross over the lines that keep us on both sides

I know, we can break our walls we've built
Erase the fear that fills our hearts
And climb until we reach the highest hills
We can have it all
We can have it all
If we shut the darkness down, and rise above
We light forever up
We light forever up
We light forever up
We light forever up

This isn't who we wanted to be (this isn't)
Wearing these faces gets complicated (wearing these faces)
But the lights going down now so take off the disguise
Let it go
We're coming back to life now just like the first time
I know

I know, we can break our walls we've built
Erase the fear that fills our hearts
And climb until we reach the highest hills
We can have it all
We can have it all
If we shut the darkness down, and rise above
We light forever up
We light forever up
We light forever up
We light forever up
