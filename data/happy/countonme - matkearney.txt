Hey
One day to get it all right
Two wrong and not enough right
Three words you said in the night
Before we held the fire
High five me brother it's amazing
Her six shooter came out blazing
7 up and coke on the pavement
Ate my heart out daily baby

Hey I love
Hey I need you
Hey I want you do you want me too

You can count on me
When you cannot see
Let me spell it out
Plain and simple now
When your numbers called
Backs against the wall
Pick you up when you fall
Be there when you call

Singing a b c
You can count on me
123
You can count on me
Amen we made it this far
B boys in VW cars
See me
Seeing into my heart
Delighted through the dark
Emails and coffee in the evening
Effort ya brother you'll believe it
Gee I don't know your secret
H.I. love you singing

Hey I love you
Hey I need you
Hey I want you do you want me too

You can count on me
When you cannot see
Let me spell it out
Plain and simple now
When your numbers called
Backs against the wall
Pick you up when you fall
Be there when you call

Singing
A B C
Add it up add it up now darling
1 2 3
Run Run when your calling
Hey, A B C
Ad it up add it up now darling
1 2 3

You can count on me
When you cannot see
Let me spell it out
Plain and simple now
When your numbers called
Backs against the wall
Pick you up when you fall
Be there when you call

Singing
A B C
You can count on me
Hey, 1 2 3
You can count on me
A B C
You can count on me
Hey, 1 2 3
You can count on me
A B C
Hey, 1 2 3
