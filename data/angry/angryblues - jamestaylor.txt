I can't help it if I don't feel so good. I can't help it if I don't feel so good.
If I had my way, I'd be sitting on the top of the world. I can't help it if I don't feel so good.

When the anger comes in and there's no place for a man to hide,
when the anger comes in and there's no place for a man to hide,
would he do anything in the world to make him feel better inside?
When the anger comes in and there's no place for a man to hide.

Gonna sit back here, and watch this cloud roll by.
Gonna sit back here, and watch this cloud roll by.
The next time that you see me I should be shining like the Fourth of July.
Gonna sit back here, gonna watch this cloud roll by.

I ain't looking for details, won't you just give me a clue? Oh, Lord, what am I gonna do?

I can't help it if I don't feel so good. I can't help it if I don't feel so good.
If I had my way, I'd be sitting on the top of the world. I can't help it if I don't feel so good.
Don't feel so good, I can't help it if I don't feel so good.
