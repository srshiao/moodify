There's a war inside my head
Sometimes I wish that I was dead, I'm broken
So I called this therapist
And she said, "Girl, you can't be fixed just take this"

I'm tired of trying to be normal
I'm always over-thinking
I'm driving myself crazy
So what if I'm fucking crazy?

And I don't need your quick fix
I don't want your prescriptions
Just 'cause you say I'm crazy
So what if I'm fucking crazy?
Yeah, I'm gonna show you

Loco, maniac, sick bitch, psychopath
Yeah, I'm gonna show you
I'm gonna show you
Yeah, I'm gonna show you
Mental out my brain, bat shit, go insane
Yeah, I'm gonna show you
I'm gonna show you
Yeah, I'm gonna show you

I've been searching city streets
Trying to find the missing piece like you said
And I searched hard only to find
There's not a single thing that's wrong with my mind

Yeah, I'm tired of tryna be normal
I'm always over-thinking
Driving myself crazy
So what if I'm fucking crazy?

And I don't need your quick fix
I don't want your prescriptions
Just 'cause you say I'm crazy
So what if I'm fucking crazy?

I'm gonna show you

Loco, maniac, sick bitch, psychopath
Yeah, I'm gonna show you
I'm gonna show you
Yeah, I'm gonna show you
Mental out my brain, bat shit, go insane
Yeah, I'm gonna show you
I'm gonna show you
I'm gonna show you

Crazy, crazy, yeah I'm gonna show you
Crazy, crazy, yeah I'm gonna show you
Crazy, crazy

Tired of tryna be normal
I'm driving myself crazy

And I don't need your quick fix
I don't want your prescriptions
Just 'cause you say I'm crazy
So what if I'm fucking crazy?

Loco, maniac, sick bitch, psychopath
