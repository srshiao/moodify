I mean it, I mean it, okay, I'm the meanest, yeah
A gift and a curse, I feel everything oh-so-deep
"Witt got me in my feelings", yeah
Said the same motherfucker hatin' on me last week
I've been runnin' 'round the city no patience
We are so close, I can motherfuckin' taste it
Came a long way from the motherfuckin' basement
Workin' over time, so no wonder why I wonder where the day went
"You will never make it, flow too angry"
Colorful complexion, said they won't play me
Okay, hate me, if you're gonna do it
I see through it, you're jealous, I'm new and love what I'm doin'
You're booin' me cause you're losin', it's funny to watch you fumble
Your word is empty and sad, like your girl, you met her on Bumble
Your team is lazy and jumbled, my team is there if I stumble
They turn a rap in a mumble, I keep it real and stay humble enough

I know where I'm from but I don't stay no more (yeah)
Cause everyone back home don't act the same no more (yeah)
So tell these motherfuckers I ain't playin' no more (woah)
I'm drownin' out my problems 'til my pain no more (yeah)

I'm goin' numb, hey
I hope you see what you've done to me
I'm goin' numb, hey
Blurry vision, live it fast
Motherfuck my past, I'm goin' numb

Still in my room, starin' up at the ceiling
It's funny how I'm weak if I tell them that I have feelings
It's funny how they think that they're relevant
But I question intelligence of a nobody who hate for the hell of it
You had your chance, girl why you cryin'?
Oh it's different because you love me now, why you lyin'?
Oh I get it, you're a mess cause the last guy you met hit and left
And that's when I get a text, you confess that you're all mine
All lyin', I've becomin' numb to it
When I said I had a dream, you put a gun to it
When you find me on your mind, I'ma run through it
When you want me back I will never give a fuck to it - I'm on a new level!
I got some new devils, I got some new demons
We're getting deeper than pussies
And sharks, only swarm when it's you bleedin'
I'm givin' music a new meaning, new meaning, now

I know where I'm from but I don't stay no more (yeah)
Cause everyone back home don't act the same no more (yeah)
So tell these motherfuckers I ain't playin' no more (woah)
I'm drownin' out my problems 'til my pain no more (yeah)

I'm goin' numb, hey
I hope you see what you've done to me
I'm goin' numb, hey
Blurry vision, live it fast
Motherfuck my past, I'm goin' numb

Nowadays rap sound like shit
Let me waste a couple lines, make it sound like this
One time I went to Atlanta
Plane got delayed so I stayed in Atlanta
Not from Atlanta but steal all the grammar
The game is in danger of me, make you feel like a panda
Panda, panda, feel like a panda
Game is in danger of me, make you feel like a panda
Damn, see what I'm sayin'?
Aren't you mad there's no passion in the music you're playin'
I ain't dissin', I'm just wishin' I could hear what you're sayin'
They're playin' a game and you're the one that's actually payin'
I'm sayin' that playin' the game, and you're a pawn to it all
Teachin' drugs over love, now we're numb to it all
Every shot you take is Novocaine, don't feel it at all
You're name-calling, I can hear it like a leaf when it falls and that's real

I know where I'm from but I don't stay no more (yeah)
Cause everyone back home don't act the same no more (yeah)
So tell these motherfuckers I ain't playin' no more (woah)
I'm drownin' out my problems 'til my pain no more (yeah)

I'm goin' numb, hey
I hope you see what you've done to me
I'm goin' numb, hey
Blurry vision, live it fast
Motherfuck my past, I'm goin' numb
I hope you see what you've done to me
I'm goin' numb, hey
Blurry vision, live it fast
Motherfuck my past, I'm goin' numb
