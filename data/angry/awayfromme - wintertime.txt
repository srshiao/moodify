When did it become lame to put money over fame?
Niggas steady haitin' cause' they broke they can't relate
It's too many fakes, to myself is where I stay
If you ain't getting paper get the fuck away from me
The fuck away from me
Get the fuck away from me
Get the fuck away from me
Get the hell around from me
Get the fuck away from me
Boy my style ain't for free
Get the fuck away from me
Get the fuck away from me

This shit effortless I be drippin' all day
Blowin' money fast, make it back and make it rain
I don't even try and I still do major plays
I can drop a song with no words a 100k the same day
Guarantee it, you can see it
Niggas mad, cause they can't be it
Why you hate me no idea
Take a seat no IKEA
No Shanaenae, oh my goodness
Disrespect me, no he wouldn't
Wintertime a young hustla' from the wish a nigga woulds
I can't not believe your nerves
Who the fuck raise these nerds
All I know is chase these checks
Fuck you and who got next
A year ago I ain't had shit
On my soul that's real shit
I had to go out and get it
I don't vaule your opinion
I just gotta ball no scrimmage
I can't care about your feelin's
Pro finnesser you can get it
Shit, anyone can get it
Fuck you over leave no witness
He gotta' wife and he got children
That's is not my damn problem, life ain't fair

Get the fuck away from me
Get the fuck away from me
Get the hell around from me
Get the fuck away from me
Boy my style ain't for free
Get the fuck away from me
Get the fuck away from me
