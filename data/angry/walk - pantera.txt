Can't you see
I'm easily
Bothered by persistence
One step from lashing
Out at you

You want in
To get under my skin
Call yourself a friend
I've got more friends like you
What do I do?

Is there no standard anymore?
What it takes, who I am, where I've been belong?
You can't be something you're not
Be yourself by yourself
Stay away from me
A lesson learned in life
Known from the dawn of time

Respect, walk
What did you say?
Respect, walk
Are you talking to me?
Are you talking to me?

Run your mouth
When I'm not around
It's easy to achieve
You cry to weak friends
That sympathize

Can you hear
The violins
Playing your song?
Those same friends
Tell me your every word

Is there no standard anymore?
What it takes, who I am, where I've been belong?
You can't be something you're not
Be yourself by yourself
Stay away from me
A lesson learned in life
Known from the dawn of time

Respect, walk
What did you say?
Respect, walk
Are you talking to me?
Respect, walk
What did you say?
Respect, walk
Are you talking to me?
Are you talking to me?

No way, punk

Respect, walk
What did you say?
Respect, walk
Are you talking to me?
Respect, walk
What did you say?
Respect, walk
Are you talking to me?
Are you talking to me?

Walk on home, boy!
