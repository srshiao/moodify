Ya, ya, ya

Maybe I just care too much, too much
I think I do, you say I don't, say I don't, say I fuckin' don't
Hate it when they stare too much, too much
Got way back like, "How you doin', how you doin', hey bitch, how you doin'?"
Never one to care for fake lo-ove
You're fake as fuck, I should've known, should've known, should've fuckin' known
Maybe I just care too much, too much
Who are you, bitch? I don't know, I don't know, I don't fuckin' know (skrrt)

Hey bitch, remember when you wouldn't play my shit?
Never saw the vision, had to paint that shit
My ex was a mess, you can take that shit
Call me crazy, bitch, like I'm Jaden Smith
Shit, he don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well I do, so fuck you, you, you
Couple lame motherfuckers, I can see right through
Hold up, wait, let me check on my YouTube too
Here's one fake fuck, five, seven, eight, nine
Says, "Oh my gosh, wait, he's shit when he rhymes
And my girlfriend left, and my life is a mess
So I sit in my bed and jack off all the time, woo!"
Don't be that dude
Man, I really get the girls that you jack to
Your old girl just got a Witt tattoo
Don't be pissed, little bitch, when I at you
They say, "Lately, I just love Uzi
I bump his shit like with all my roomies
I shake my ass to his music too, see
'Erase Your Social,' it was almost too deep
Did you just say that he bit off Witt?
That can't be true, because Witt is shit
Someone grab my phone, I needa google this"
(Ya, ya, ya) "Oh shit!"

Maybe I just care too much, too much
I think I do, you say I don't, say I don't, say I fuckin' don't
Hate it when they stare too much, too much
Got way back like, "How you doin', how you doin', hey bitch, how you doin'?"
Never one to care for fake lo-ove
You're fake as fuck, I should've known, should've known, should've fuckin' known
Maybe I just care too much, too much
Who are you, bitch? I don't know, I don't know, I don't fuckin' know (skrrt)

I been gettin' colder as the seasons go
The rap game, the new Game of Thrones
Sayin', "Rap is dead, mumble rap instead"
Run it back to life like it's Jon Snow
I'm the one and only, better not forget
I'm the one and only, there is no one left
There's a lot of fakin' in your fuckin' flex
I lied enough and in your fuckin' cheques, woo!
What do you do?
He said, "I sit at the bar gettin' drunk with a few dudes
And I really love Hulu
And I really love watchin' these rappers on YouTube
I feel cool while I'm watchin' a guy
Talk about gettin' high and the bitches he fucks, ya
Even though I can't relate
Because I am a lame, had a piss in a cup, ya"
You make music with a close mind
I make music that is very open
You make music for the strip club
I make music for the barely copin'
Fuck your blog, yeah, I fuckin' read it
I manifest and I fuckin' get it
Bitch, I'm the best, yeah, I fuckin' said it
(Ya ya ya) Haha

Maybe I just care too much, too much
I think I do, you say I don't, say I don't, say I fuckin' don't
Hate it when they stare too much, too much
Got way back like, "How you doin', how you doin', hey bitch, how you doin'?"
Never one to care for fake lo-ove
You're fake as fuck, I should've known, should've known, should've fuckin' known
Maybe I just care too much, too much
Who are you, bitch? I don't know, I don't know, I don't fuckin' know (skrrt)
