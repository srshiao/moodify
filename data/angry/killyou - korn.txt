Lady life, don't you cry
My life, pain is God
Many nights, painfull thoughts of her
Yell at me, again I'm wrong

In denial, I tried to be your friend
I tried to be a good boy
All I see, a hate deep inside
Startle me, someone save me

Now these memories, fill my heart, they bury me

All I wanna do!
You are not my real mother
Is kill you
Should I'd beat and stab and fuck her

Looking back I was never ever right
You were my step-mom who always wanted me out of your sight
I would come walkin' in and I 'd say hello,
but you slap me and you make some fucked up comment about my
clothes
So I tried to let it pass, but the visions in my head
were with you, with a knife up your ass, laying dead
so I pop some more caps in your ass,
Now your son is not so fun
Motherfucking bitch! Never try to play me!!!

You made my life not so good

All I wanna do! . . . is kill you

<i>[chorus]</i>

Wish you were dead now!!!

How can I cry over someone I never loved?
How can I cry over someone I never loved?
Never loved. . .
