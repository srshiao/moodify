don't
look too
long in my
face
it could be a
big mistake
i'm hanging on a
thread so fine
i need a little space
i shouldn't say but i
know i must
i've had enough of pain
i'm pissed off standing in
the rain

it makes me feel like a mad dog
i got nothing to lose
mad dog
you got nothing i can use
mad dog howling at the moon
a mad dog

i need no friends
i'm on the edge of a broken dream
laughing at the pain but it makes me want to
scream
i should have known she'd be no good
she tore my heart in two but i don't need to talk to
you

you make me feel like a mad dog
i got nothing to lose
mad dog
you got nothing i can use
mad dog howling at the moon
a mad dog

she said a hard man is good to find
and then she raised a doubt
all that i could give she took
and then she threw me out
well i don't care i don't care anymore
i'm going to lose my grip
i'm going to let it rip
