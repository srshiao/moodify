Tonight, my head is spinning
I need something to pick me up
I’ve tried but nothing is working
I won’t stop
I won’t say I’ve had enough
Tonight, I start the fire
Tonight, I break away

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Break away from everybody
Break away from everything
If you can’t stand the way
This place is
Take yourself to higher places

(ohhh, ohhh)

At night I feel like a vampire
It’s not right 
I just can’t give it up
I’ll try to get myself higher
Let’s go
We’re going to light it up
Tonight we start the fire
Tonight we break away

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Break away from everybody
Break away from everything
If you can’t stand the way 
This place is
Take yourself to higher places

If you can’t stand the way this place is
Take (take) yourself (yourself)
To higher places

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Break away from everybody
Break away from everything
If you can’t stand the way 
This place is
Take yourself to higher places

(ohh…higher places)
(ohh…to higher places)
(ohh…higher places)
Take yourself to higher places
