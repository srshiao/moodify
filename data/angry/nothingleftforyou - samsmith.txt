Maybe I'm done
Maybe it's true
Maybe I had one chance
And I lost it with you
We fell so hard
With nothing to lose
I'll never love again
I'll never love you

'Cause I gave
My heart
To a goddamn fool
I gave him everything
Now there's nothing left for you
'Cause I gave
My heart
To a goddamn fool
I lost everything
Now I have nothing left for you
I have nothing left for you

I can't pretend
Pretend that I care
I see how you look at me
But I am not there
The damage is done
I'll save you the time
And if there are feelings there
They are not mine

'Cause I gave
My heart
To a goddamn fool
I gave him everything
Now there's nothing left for you
'Cause I gave
My heart
To a goddamn fool
I lost everything
And I have nothing left for you
Oh, I have nothing left for you
No

You won't hear me say those words again
This is something that you cannot mend
Can't you see I am a product of my own past
So I know this will never last
And I will not cover your fears
I will not pick up your tears
I'll live out the rest of my days alone

'Cause I gave
My heart
To a goddamn fool
I gave him everything
Now there's nothing left for you
'Cause I gave
My heart
To a goddamn fool
I lost everything
And I have nothing left for you
