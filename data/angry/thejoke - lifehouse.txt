When you find me in the morning
Hanging on a warning
Oh... the joke is on you
You said you were pretending
Here's to unhappy endings
Oh... the joke is on you

To make sure yesterday doesn't repeat
I took a shortcut home, a left on the street
I know they won't find me here
I found out how to make mama proud
Be real quiet don't talk too loud
I try, try to disappear

My life is for the taking
Breakdown is awaking me
I'm ending all this pain

When you find me in the morning
Hanging on a warning
Oh... the joke is on you
You said you were pretending
Here's to unhappy endings
Oh... the joke is on you

This is my last day
Should have been my first kiss
Think to myself will I ever be missed
I hope... or maybe I don't care
I wear my team around my neck
I love them so much gonna love them to death
Tonight... see the world through my eyes

My life is for the taking
Breakdown is  erasing me
I'm ending all this pain

My great escape
Is my biggest mistake
I think you better turn around
Don't throw it away
Today... today...
