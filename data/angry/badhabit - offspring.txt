Hey man you know I'm really okay
The gun in my hand will tell you the same
But when I'm in my car
Don't give me no crap
'Cause the slightest thing and I just might snap

When I go driving I stay in my lane
But getting cut off it makes me insane
I open the glove box
Reach inside
I'm gonna wreck this fucker's ride

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
I guess I got a bad habit
Of blowin' away (yeah, yeah)
I got a bad habit (yeah, yeah)
And it ain't goin' away (yeah, yeah)
Yeah (yeah, yeah)
Yeah (yeah, yeah)

Well they say the road is a dangerous place
If you flip me off I'll get in your face
If you drive on my ass
Your foot's on the gas
And your next breath is your last

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Drivers are rude
Such attitudes
But when I show my piece
Complaints cease
Something's odd
I feel like I'm god
You stupid dumb shit goddamn motherfucker!

I open the glove box
Reach inside
I'm gonna wreck this fucker's ride

<i>[Chorus]</i>
