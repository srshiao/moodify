Take everything left from me
All!
To!
Blame!

How can we still succeed, taking what we don't need?
Telling lies, alibis, selling all the hate that we breed.
Supersize our tragedies! (You can't define me or justify greed)
Bought in the land of the free! (Land! Free!)

And we're all to blame,
We've gone too far,
From pride to shame,
We're trying so hard,
We're dying in vain,
We're hopelessly blissful and blind
To all we are,
We want it all with no sacrifice!

Realize we spend our lives living in a culture of fear.
Stand to salute; say thanks to the man of the year.
How did we all come to this? (You can't define me or justify greed)
This greed that we just can't resist! (Resist!)

And we're all to blame,
We've gone too far,
From pride to shame,
We're trying so hard,
We're dying in vain,
We're hopelessly blissful and blind
To all we are,
We want it all.
Everyone wants it all with no sacrifice!

Tell me now, what have we done? We don't know.
I can't allow what has begun to tear me down,
Believe me now, we have no choice left with our 
Backs against the wall!

And now we're all to blame,
We've gone too far,
From pride to shame,
We're hopelessly blissful and blind
When all we need
Is something true
To believe,
Don't we all?
Everyone, everyone,
We will fall.

'Cause we're all to blame
We've gone too far,
From pride to shame,
We're trying so hard,
We're dying in vain,
We want it all,
Everyone, don't we all?
