Pick up the phone
Please, tell me you’re home
The monsters are gone
The wardrobe is closed
Where’s my guitar
They hate when I sing
So, fuck my guitar, yeah
Fuck everything

Mmmm mmmm (x2)

String’s on a twist
My ass they can kiss
They’re making me sick
Just, go suck my dick
No, singing past ten
You can’t stay in your bed
So, fuck mom and dad
I’m going real mad

Mmmm mmmm (x4)
