Lend me your brakes again, you're
More than my speed
But I've played heart strings before, but
Not in your key
You tell me you're waiting for someone, but
You haven’t heard, no
You broken promises to me
So forget your word
And again, and again, you’re breaking me down
Let me in, let me in
For the doctor is down

Why am I bitter, bitter, bitter?
Why am I always led astray?
It's gonna get better, better, better
I'd always hear you say

Tell me I’m great again
And I love you more
Ride high fake confidence
Right down to my core
It’s dragging up like an airstrike raid
All under my skin
I wear a mask to cover myself
In the shape of a grin
And again, and again, you’re breaking me down
Let me in, let me in
For the doctor is down

Why am I bitter, bitter, bitter?
Why am I always let it stay?
It's gonna get better, better, better
I've always heard you say
