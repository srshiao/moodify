Ya, ya, ya

Maybe I just care too much, too much
I think I do, you say I don't, say I don't, say I fuckin' don't
Hate it when they stare too much, too much
I wave back like, "How you doin', how you doin', hey, bitch, how you doin'?"
Never one to care for fake lo-ove
You're fake as fuck, I should've known, should've known, should've fuckin' known
Maybe I just care too much, too much
Who are you, bitch? I don't know, I don't know, I don't fuckin' know (skrrt)

Hey, bitch, remember when you wouldn't play my shit?
Never saw the vision, had to paint that shit
My ex was a mess, you can take that shit
Call me crazy, bitch, like I'm Jaden Smith
Shit, he don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well, I do, so fuck you, you, you
Couple lame motherfuckers, I can see right through
Hold up, wait, let me check on my YouTube too
Here's one fake fuck, five, seven, eight, nine
Says, "Oh my gosh, Witt, he's shit when he rhymes
And my girlfriend left, and my life is a mess
So I sit in my bed and jack off all the time, woo!"
Don't be that dude
Man, I really get the girls that you jack to
Your old girl just got a Witt tattoo
Don't be pissed, little bitch, when I @ you
They say, "Lately, I just love Uzi
I bump his shit like with all my roomies
I shake my ass to his music too, see
'Erase Your Social,' it was almost too deep
Did you just say that he bit off Witt?
That can't be true, because Witt is shit
Someone grab my phone, I need to Google this"
(Ya, ya, ya) "Oh shit!"
