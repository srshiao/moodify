I'm in a bad mood
Got an ache in my head
You always knew me
I'm the one who gets out the books under the bed

I'm feeling [?]
My outlook's grey
So I make sure everyone
Joins me in another miserable day

Cause I'm angry angry
I'm so irate
I'm angry angry
I work myself into a terrible state

I'm angry angry
Down to my soul
I'm angry angry
My blood is up and I'm out of control

Friends all think that I'm toad
When they see me, they cross the road
I'll get even, I'll get back
Smile so sweet and then attack

I'll scream and shout
On the phone all day
Stamp my feet
To get my way

I'll be obnoxious
Rude and rough
Then hide away
Before they call, call, call

My bluff

My wife just left me
She's taken the kids
How could a nice guy like me
So quickly end up on the skids

I'm feeling lonely
And sorry for myself
The world's against me
It's not my fault; it's everyone else

I'm angry angry
I'm all fired up
I'm angry angry
Sensitivity's high and I'm ready to [?]

I'm angry angry
I'm looking for a fight
I'm angry angry
I got to be [?] I got to be right
