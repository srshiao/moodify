Catch a star as it falls and hold it in your hand
Feel the heat still it burns searing embers of your glorious sun
Oh this is painful this endless aching need
The very thing I long for is what brings me to my knees

You walked in to my world won me over caught me so off guard
But I gave in to the wonder to the poetry of our souls set fire
And oh it was beautiful our tender hearts entwined
And I thought we could conquer any mountains we would climb

And now I’m waiting on the light
To ease the fury of this one desire
I’m trying to be patient I’m trying to stay high
I’m trying to find the wisdom in this long goodbye

Stop the world stop the noise I’ve heard enough my head is spinning ‘round
Give me more than words to feed me truth I can believe in give me solid ground
But our days are measured in fraying threads of gold
Every day unraveling till there’s nothing left to hold

Now I’m still waiting on the light
To ease the fury of this losing fight
I’m trying to forgive you to hold my head up high
I’m trying to find the wisdom in this long goodbye

I gave my love gave it all but in the end it didn’t change a thing
You can’t love a man out of his fate can’t tame a head and heart so out of sync
But oh I am grateful this will not bring me down
The tides are always gonna turn and come on back around
