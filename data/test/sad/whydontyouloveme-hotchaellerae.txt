See I can't wake up I'm living a nightmare
That keeps playing over again
Locked in a room so hung up on you
And you're cool with just being friends
Left on the sidelines
Stuck at a red light
Waiting for my time
And I can't see
Why don't you love me
Touch me, tell me I'm your everything
The air you breathe
And why don't you love me, baby
Open up your heart tonight
'cause I could be all that you need
Why don't you love me
Why don't you love me
See I'm just too scared to tell you the truth
Cause my heart ache can't take anymore
Broken and bruised longing for you
And I don't know what I'm waiting for
Left on the sidelines
Stuck at a red light
Waiting for my time
So just tell me
Why don't you love me
Touch me, tell me I'm your everything
The air you breathe
And why don't you love me, baby
Open up your heart tonight
I could be all that you need
Why don't you love me
Why don't you love me
Why don't you give me a reason
Please tell me the truth
You know that I'll keep believing
Till I'm with you
Why don't you love me
Kiss me, I could feel your heart tonight
It's killing me so
Why don't you love me
Touch me, tell me I'm your everything
The air you breathe
And why don't you love me, baby
Open up your heart tonight
I could be all that you need
Why don't you love me
Why don't you love me
Why don't you love me
