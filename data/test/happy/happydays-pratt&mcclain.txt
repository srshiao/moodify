Happy Days
Sunday, Monday, Happy Days, 
Tuesday, Wednesday, Happy Days, 
Thursday, Friday, Happy Days, 
Saturday, what a day, 
Rockin all week with you. 
This day is ours 
Won't you be mine. (Oh Happy Days) 
This day is ours (Oh Happy Days) 
Oh please be mine. 
Hello sunshine, goodbye rain, 
She's wearing my high school ring on her chain. 
She's my steady, I'm her man, 
I'm gonna love her all I can.
Gonna cruise her round the town, 
Show everybody what I've found 
Rock'n'roll with all my friends 
Hopin' the music never ends. 
These Happy Days are yours and mine (oh Happy Days) 
These Happy Days are yours and mine (oh Happy Days) 
These Happy Days are yours and mine, Happy Days.
