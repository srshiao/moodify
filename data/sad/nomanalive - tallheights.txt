You know I think it was born of the feeling
That I got when I left from your home
Then it turned into something appealing I
Couldn't let it alone

Who'd have known that I'd ever be reeling
Simply from being on my own
Oh I craved and I craved and I craved and I craved
To get back that feeling I'd known

But the way you were looking that evening
When you showed me out to your door
Oh I felt like we'd both been caught stealing
From the garden your parents had grown

It's a long way from Earth to the heavens
But I didn't care anymore
I just waited and waited and waited and waited
Until I could get you alone

Who ever heard such a voice of excitement?
No man alive had ever been there
Staking a claim on an uncharted island
Ooh it was too much to bear
No man alive had ever been there

Well we didn't make it together
But I didn't go it alone
See the feeling was no longer tethered
To the sweetheart it used to call home

Now we're spread like a blanket of heather
Covering soil and stone
Oh it bid me to lay with a bird of a feather
And then to set out on my own

Who ever heard such a voice of excitement?
No man alive had ever been there
Staking a claim on an uncharted island
Ooh it was too much to bear
No man alive had ever been there

Who ever heard such a voice of excitement?
No man alive had ever been there
Staking a claim on an uncharted island
Ooh it was too much to bear
No man alive had ever been there

I think it was born of the feeling
That I got when I left from your home
Oh I waited and waited and waited and waited
To get back that feeling I'd known
