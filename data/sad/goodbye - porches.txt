I feel it move I feel it ache
It's sad to see how much you change
I slip into a cold lake
Now I just feel it slip away

Into a light
That I once knew
I swam deep
And thought of you

I like the thought you think of me
It softer as I start to sink
The trees were sex, an orange sky
It is so sad to say goodbye

Into a light
That I once knew
I swam deep
And thought of you
