I was only looking for a shortcut home
But it's complicated
So complicated
Somewhere in this city is a road I know
Where we could make it
But maybe there's no making it now

Too long we've been denying
Now we're both tired of trying
We hit a wall and we can't get over it
Nothing to relive
It's water under the bridge
You said it, I get it
I guess it is what it is

I was only trying to bury the pain
But I made you cry and I can't stop the crying
Was only trying to save me
But I lost you again
Now there's only lying
Wish I could say it's only me

Too long we've been denying
Now we're both tired of trying
We hit a wall and we can't get over it
Nothing to relive
It's water under the bridge
You said it, I get it
I guess it is what it is

Here it comes ready or not
We both found out it's not how we thought
That it would be, how it would be
If the time could turn us around
What once was lost may be found
For you and me, for you and me

Too long we've been denying
Now we're both tired of trying
We hit a wall and we can't get over it
Nothing left to relive
It's water under the bridge
You said it, I get it
I guess it is what it is

I was only looking for a shortcut home
But it's complicated
So complicated
