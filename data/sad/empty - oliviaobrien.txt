I can't handle these pressures
All I can say is this stress hurts
Things are supposed to get better
I just need to put myself first
I'm always trying my hardest
Not to pick myself apart, this
Energy's killing my vibes now
Sometimes I just wanna drown out
All of the thoughts in my mind
Too much going on at the same time
I wish it would stop and I've tried, but
Life just sucks then we all die

That's just reality, yeah don't lie to me
Yeah I'm fucked up but I don't wanna be

I wonder if I'm good enough
But maybe I've just had too much
To drink, to smoke, to swallow
I'm drownin' up my sorrows
There's rules I'll never follow
Pretend there's no tomorrow
I wish there was no tomorrow

But I'm empty inside, yeah I'm empty inside
And I don't wanna live but I'm too scared to die
Yeah I'm empty inside, I just don't feel alive
And I don't wanna live but I'm too scared to die

Wish I could erase my memories
So I could stop feeling so empty
I wish this shit wasn't so tempting
But it's hard to resist when there's plenty
Of things I could do to fuck me up
I wanna let go but I'm feeling so stuck
So all I can do is fill up my cup
And sit here alone hoping no one disrupts

That's just reality, yeah don't lie to me
Yeah I'm fucked up but I don't wanna be

I wonder if I'm good enough
But maybe I've just had too much
To drink, to smoke, to swallow
I'm drownin' up my sorrows
There's rules I'll never follow
Pretend there's no tomorrow
I wish there was no tomorrow

But I'm empty inside, yeah I'm empty inside
And I don't wanna live but I'm too scared to die
Yeah I'm empty inside, I just don't feel alive
And I don't wanna live but I'm too scared to die

My body's shakin'
My head is achin'
It feels like my heart is breakin'
My body's shakin'
My head is achin'
I can't fix this mess I'm makin'

But I'm empty inside, yeah I'm empty inside
And I don't wanna live but I'm too scared to die
Yeah I'm empty inside, I just don't feel alive
And I don't wanna live but I'm too scared to die
