Said he tried to phone me
But I never have time
He said that I never listen
But I don't even try
I got a new place in Cali
But I'm gone every night
So I fill it with strangers
So they keep on the lights
She said she told you she knows me
But the face isn't right
She asked if I recognized her
And I told her I might

See, everywhere I go
I got a million different people tryna' kick it
But I'm still alone in my mind

I know you're dying to meet me
But I can just tell you this
Baby, as soon as you meet me
You'll wish that you never did
(You'll wish that you never did)

I stayed a night out in Paris
Where they don't know my name
And I got into some trouble
With that drink in my veins
I got a problem with parties
'Cause it's loud in my brain
And I can never say sorry
'Cause I won't take the blame
I know I always go missing
And you're lying awake
But if you ask why I'm distant
Oh, I'm runnin' away

You know that everywhere I go
I got a million different people tryna' kick it
But I'm still alone in my mind

I know you're dying to meet me
But I can just tell you this
Baby, as soon as you meet me
You'll wish that you never did
(You'll wish that you never did)

I, I know you wanna
I, I know you wanna
I, I know you wanna
Slip under my armor
I, I know you wanna
I, I know you wanna
I, I know you wanna
Slip under my armor

See, everywhere I go
I got a million different people tryna' hit it
But I'm still alone in my mind

I know you're dying to meet me
But I can just tell you this
Baby, as soon as you meet me
You'll wish that you never did
(You'll wish that you never did)
Yeah

(I know you wanna)
(I, I know you wanna)
You'll wish that you never did
(I know you wanna)
(Slip under my armor)
Oh
(I know you wanna)
(I, I know you wanna)
You'll wish that you never did
