Da-doo, da-doo, doo doo doo, doo doo
Da-doo, da-doo, doo doo doo, doo doo
Da-doo, da-doo, doo doo doo, doo doo
Da-doo, da-doo, doo doo doo, doo doo

It's time for moving on
There's some things you can't forget
It's sinking us like a stone
I just wanna bury it

I wanna watch all my bridges burn
Stand in the rain 'til the page is turned
Dance in the light of a lesson learned, lesson learned
I wanna leave everything that hurts
Never go back to the way we were
Set it on fire, baby, watch it burn, watch it burn

Da-doo, da-doo, doo doo doo, doo doo
Da-doo, da-doo, doo doo doo, doo doo

Out into the unknown
We traded in our regrets
Not gonna go alone
'Cause we're gonna finish this

I wanna watch all my bridges burn
Stand in the rain 'til the page is turned
Dance in the light of a lesson learned, lesson learned
I wanna leave everything that hurts
Never go back to the way we were
Set it on fire, baby, watch it burn, watch it burn

Burn it all, set me free
And let the smoke blow on out to the sea
I need to find somewhere I can believe
I need to know there's a chance we can be
Burn it all, set me free
And let the smoke blow on out to the sea
I need to find somewhere I can believe
I need to know there's a chance we can be

I wanna watch all my bridges burn
Stand in the rain 'til the page is turned
Dance in the light of a lesson learned, lesson learned
I wanna leave everything that hurts
Never go back to the way we were
Set it on fire, baby, watch it burn, watch it burn

Da-doo, da-doo, doo doo doo, doo doo
Da-doo, da-doo, doo doo doo, doo doo
Da-doo, da-doo, doo doo doo, doo doo
Da-doo, da-doo, doo doo doo, doo doo
