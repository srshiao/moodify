Thought we were going  
And go up the field a ways  
And join all the other living souls  
But you never came  

Robbed of your fortune  
You get disappointments in life  
You're probably poisoning your body  
I hope you're alright  

In a moment of fear  
You dig in your heels  
The pills won't help you now  
Once you're crying

I hope you're alright
