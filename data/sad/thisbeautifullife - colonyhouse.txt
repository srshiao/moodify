What in the world are we doing here?
What is the meaning of it all?
To fall in love, to make a life that's calm and stable
Or just to find a place where I belong?

What in the world am I looking for?
What is the peace that I can find?
This longing for, I can't ignore but am I able
To see the good and taste it on my tongue?

All that I know
Al that I see
All that I feel
Inside of me
All that I've done
All that I've tried
There must be more
To this beautiful life

Well I go to water to find innocence
Breathe deep the air to fill my lungs
And beauty sings his songs to me
Every note I follow to find out where
The voice is coming from

All that I know
Al that I see
All that I feel
Inside of me
All that I've done
All that I've tried
There must be more
To this beautiful life

And I can't be satisfied
This world has long been dry
What does it cost to find a home
For what's been lost?

Well maybe I'm a part of something that's bigger than me
Like I'm a page in a book in a library
And inside my heart there's a dying part that's always searching
'Cause I know that there's a place where I belong

All that I know
Al that I see
All that I feel
Inside of me
All that I've done
All that I've tried
There must be more
To this wonderful
Terrible
Beautiful life
