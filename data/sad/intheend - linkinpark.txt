<i>[Chester Bennington:]</i>
It starts with one
<i>[Mike Shinoda:]</i>
One thing I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time

<i>[Chester Bennington:]</i>
All I know
<i>[Mike Shinoda:]</i>
All I know time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

<i>[Chester Bennington:]</i>
It's so unreal
<i>[Mike Shinoda:]</i>
It's so unreal, didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, did-didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go

<i>[Chester Bennington:]</i>
Watch you go
<i>[Mike Shinoda:]</i>
I kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I tried so hard

<i>[Chester Bennington:]</i>
I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

<i>[Mike Shinoda:]</i>
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard

<i>[Chester Bennington:]</i>
I tried so hard
<i>[Mike Shinoda:]</i>
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far

<i>[Chester Bennington:]</i>
Got so far
<i>[Mike Shinoda:]</i>
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end

<i>[Chester Bennington:]</i>
In the end
<i>[Mike Shinoda:]</i>
You kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I tried so hard

<i>[Chester Bennington:]</i>
I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
