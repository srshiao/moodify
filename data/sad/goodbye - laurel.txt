Oh I wish you were to call, or come back sooner
This town feels different now you're gone
And everywhere I look, you're in my eyes
'Cause I love you, baby I'm dyin'

Oh this city held my hands
Told my friends you weren't <i>[?]</i>
When you didn't come and I would cry
But I guess that you're clean of me now

Too much too soon
Gotta call it off
Too much to lose
Maybe you didn't love
Goodbye baby, it's incomplete without
It's incomplete without you

Play we're cool until a deeper love
Don't understand yah
Giving me days just to cry you dry
The silence, oh it's just how you talk
And I'm clean of you now

Too much too soon
You gotta call it off
Too much to lose
Maybe you didn't love
Goodbye baby, it's incomplete without
It's incomplete without you

Too much too soon
You gotta call it off
Maybe you didn't love
Goodbye baby, it's incomplete without
It's incomplete without you
