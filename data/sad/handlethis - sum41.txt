You said it once before
You don't do those things you used to anymore
You say in doubt
We're fading out
Forgetting who we used to be

'Cause I will bring you down
I don't wanna miss
I don't think you can handle this
You've lost what you can't find
Never what you had in mind

You take it with a smile
It's so easy when you're always in denial
Just in time
But out of line
I can't make all the same mistakes you want me to

'Cause I will bring you down
I don't want to miss
I don't think you can handle this
You've lost what you can't find
Never what you had in mind

You're giving up, you know it's not what you need
And it's true what you're going through
Try so hard not to listen to everything I never say

'Cause I will bring you down
I don't want to miss
I don't think you can handle this

'Cause I will bring you down
I don't want to miss
And I don't think you can handle this
You've lost what you can't find
Never what you had in mind

<i>[2x]</i>
I'm getting over getting used to
And after all that I put you through
Now I see I'm not the only one
I never thought it'd ever come to
This in fact was never what
You wanted from me
Or how you meant it to be
