Happy,Good times These are the good times Leave your cares behind These are the good times  Good times These are the good times Our new state of mind These are the good times  Happy days are here again The time is right for making friends Lets get together how bout a quarter to ten? Come tomorrow lets all do it again  Boys will be boys better let them have their toys Girls will be girls cute ponytails and curls Must put an end to this stress and strife I think I want to live the sporty life  Good times These are the good times Leave your cares behind These are the good times  Good times These are the good times Our new state of mind These are the good times  A rumor has it that its getting late Time marches on just cant wait The clock keeps turning why hesitate? You silly fool you cant change your fate  Lets cut the rug a little jive and jitterbug We want the best we wont settle for less Dont be a drag participate Clams on the half shell and roller-skates roller-skates  Good times These are the good times Leave your cares behind These are the good times  Good times These are the good times Our new state of mind These are the good times  Good times  Good times These are the good times Our new state of mind These are the good times
Happy,You were a child Crawling on your knees toward it Making momma so proud But your voice is too loud We like to watch you laughing You pick the insects off plants No time to think of consequences  Control yourself Take only what you need from it A family of trees wanting to be haunted Control yourself Take only what you need from it A family of trees wanting to be haunted  The water is warm But its sending me shivers A baby is born Crying out for attention The memories fade Like looking through a fogged mirror Decisions to decisions are made and not bought But I thought this wouldnt hurt a lot I guess not  [6x] Control yourself Take only what you need from it A family of trees wanting to be haunted Control yourself Take only what you need from it A family of trees wanting to be haunted  Control yourself Take only what you need from it A family of trees wanting To be haunted Control yourself Take only what you need from it A family of trees wanting To be haunted Control yourself Take only what you need from it A family of trees wanting To be haunted Control yourself Take only what you need from it A family of trees

Happy,How many times Can I push it aside Is it time I befriended all the ghosts of all the things that haunt me most So they leave me alone Move on with my life Be certain the steps of left and right dont fight the direction of upright  Id rather forget and not slow down Than gather regret for the things I cant change now If I become what I cant accept Resurrect the saint from within the wretch Pour over me and wash my hands of it  Its time to decide Which is out of my mind Cause itll be me unless I put some thoughts to rest and leave some faults behind Ill watch the glint in my eye Shine off the spring in my step And could be blinding depending on the amount of You that I reflect  Cause I could spend my life just trying to sift through What I couldve done better but what good do what ifs do Oh oh Oh oh Theres something I should tell you now

Sad,Time passes by direction unknown. Youve left us now but were not alone. Before you know it your cups overflown. You measure no one that Ive ever known.  And its quite alright. And goodbye for now. Just look up to the stars and believe who you are cause its quite alright. And so long goodbye.  We always knew that itd come to this. Its times like these I forget what I miss. Matters of heart are hard to address. Especially when yours is full of emptiness.  And its quite alright. And goodbye for now. Just look up to the stars and believe who you are cause its quite alright. And so long goodbye.  Time passes by direction unknown. Youve left us now but were not alone.

Sad,Took the breath from my open mouth Never known how it broke me down I went in circles somewhere else Shook the best when your love was home Storing up on your summer glow You went in search of someone else  And I hear your ship is comin in Your tears a sea for me to swim And I hear a storm is comin in My dear is it all weve ever been?  Caught the air in your woven mouth Leave it all Ill be hearing how you went In search of someone else They taught the hand that taut the bride Both our eyes locked to the tide We went in circles somewhere else  And I hear your ship is comin in Your tears a sea for me to swim And I hear a storm is comin in My dear is it all weve ever been?  Anchor up to me love Anchor up to me love Anchor up to me love Oh anchor up to me My love my love my love

If I ever feel better Remind me to spend some good time with you You can give me your number When its all over Ill let you know  Hang on to the good days I can lean on my friends They help me going through hard times But Im feeding the enemy Im in league with the foe Blame me for whats happening I cant try I cant try I cant try...  No one knows the hard times I went through If happiness came I miss the call The stormy days aint over Ive tried and lost know I think that I pay the cost Now Ive watched all my castles fall They were made of dust after all Someday all this mess will make me laugh I cant wait I cant wait I cant wait...

Sad,Im not sure why it always goes downhill Why broken cisterns never could stay filled Ive spent ten years singing gravity away But the water keeps on falling from the sky  And here tonight while the stars are blacking out With every hope and dream Ive ever had in doubt Ive spent ten years trying to sing these doubts away But the water keeps on falling from my eyes  And heaven knows... heaven knows I tried to find a cure for the pain Oh my Lord to suffer like you do... It would be a lie to run away  So blood is fire pulsing through our veins  Were either riders or fools behind the reins Ive spent ten years trying to sing it all away But the water keeps on falling from my tries  And heaven knows... heaven knows I tried to find a cure for the pain Oh my Lord to suffer like you do... It would be a lie to run away A lie to run It would be a lie It would be a lie to run away  It keeps on falling It keeps on falling It keeps on falling It keeps on falling The water keeps on falling from my eyes  And heaven knows... heaven knows I tried to find a cure for the pain Oh my Lord to suffer like you do...

Sad,You know I think it was born of the feeling That I got when I left from your home Then it turned into something appealing I Couldnt let it alone  Whod have known that Id ever be reeling Simply from being on my own Oh I craved and I craved and I craved and I craved To get back that feeling Id known  But the way you were looking that evening When you showed me out to your door Oh I felt like wed both been caught stealing From the garden your parents had grown  Its a long way from Earth to the heavens But I didnt care anymore I just waited and waited and waited and waited Until I could get you alone  Who ever heard such a voice of excitement? No man alive had ever been there Staking a claim on an uncharted island Ooh it was too much to bear No man alive had ever been there  Well we didnt make it together But I didnt go it alone See the feeling was no longer tethered To the sweetheart it used to call home  Now were spread like a blanket of heather Covering soil and stone Oh it bid me to lay with a bird of a feather And then to set out on my own  Who ever heard such a voice of excitement? No man alive had ever been there Staking a claim on an uncharted island Ooh it was too much to bear No man alive had ever been there  Who ever heard such a voice of excitement? No man alive had ever been there Staking a claim on an uncharted island Ooh it was too much to bear No man alive had ever been there  I think it was born of the feeling That I got when I left from your home Oh I waited and waited and waited and waited To get back that feeling Id known

You loved that lamb With every sinful bone And there you wept alone Your heart was so contrite  You said Jesus please forgive me of my crimes Sanctify this withered heart of mine Stay with me until my life is through And on that day please take me home with you  I can smell the death on the sheets Covering me I cant believe this is the end I can hear You whisper to me Its time to leave Youll never be lonely again  But this was my deathbed I died there alone When I closed my eyes tonight You carried me home  [Jon Foreman of Switchfoot sings as the voice of Jesus:] I am the Way Follow Me And take My hand And I am the Truth Embrace Me and youll understand And I am the Life And for Me youll live again For I am Love I am Love I I am Love

Sad,Life it seems will fade away Drifting further every day Getting lost within myself Nothing matters no one else  I have lost the will to live Simply nothing more to give There is nothing more for me Need the end to set me free  Things not what they used to be Missing one inside of me Deathly lost this cant be real Cannot stand this hell I feel  Emptiness is filling me To the point of agony Growing darkness taking dawn I was me but now hes gone  No one but me can save myself but its too late Now I cant think think why I should even try  Yesterday seems as though it never existed Death greets me warm now I will just say goodbye

Sad,I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill I threw the day-old tea from the cup Packed up the photo album Matthew had made Memories of a life thats been loved  Took the Get Well Soon cards and stuffed animals Poured the old ginger beer down the sink Dad always told me Dont you cry when youre down. But mum theres a tear every time that I blink  Oh Im in pieces. Its tearing me up but I know A heart thats broke is a heart thats been loved  So Ill sing Hallelujah You were an angel in the shape of my mum When I fell down youd be there holding me up Spread your wings as you go And when God takes you back Hell say Hallelujah youre home.  I fluffed the pillows made the beds stacked the chairs up Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case John said hed drive then put his hand on my cheek And wiped a tear from the side of my face  And I hope that I see the world as you did cause I know A life with love is a life thats been lived  So Ill sing Hallelujah You were an angel in the shape of my mum When I fell down youd be there holding me up Spread your wings as you go when God takes you back Hell say Hallelujah youre home.  Hallelujah You were an angel in the shape of my mum You got to see the person I have become Spread your wings and I know That when God took you back he said Hallelujah youre home.

Sad,Well do it all Everything On our own  We dont need Anything Or anyone  If I lay here If I just lay here Would you lie with me and just forget the world?  I dont quite know How to say How I feel  Those three words Are said too much Theyre not enough  If I lay here If I just lay here Would you lie with me and just forget the world?  Forget what were told Before we get too old Show me a garden thats bursting into life  Lets waste time Chasing cars Around our heads  I need your grace To remind me To find my own  If I lay here If I just lay here Would you lie with me and just forget the world?  Forget what were told Before we get too old Show me a garden thats bursting into life  All that I am All that I ever was Is here in your perfect eyes theyre all I can see  I dont know where Confused about how as well Just know that these things will never change for us at all  If I lay here If I just lay here Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
Sad,Im dancing with my demons Im hanging off the edge Storm clouds gather beneath me Waves break above my head Head-first hallucination  I wanna fall wide awake now You tell me its alright Tell me Im forgiven tonight But nobody can save me now Im holding up a light Chasing out the darkness inside Cause nobody can save me  Stared into this illusion For answers yet to come I chose a false solution But nobody proved me wrong Head-first hallucination  I wanna fall wide awake Watch the ground giving way now You tell me its alright Tell me Im forgiven tonight But nobody can save me now Im holding up a light Im chasing out the darkness inside Cause nobody can save me  Been searching somewhere out there For whats been missing right here (I wanna fall wide awake now) Ive been searching somewhere out there For whats been missing right here  I wanna fall wide awake now So tell me its alright Tell me Im forgiven tonight And only I can save me now Im holding up a light Chasing out the darkness inside And I dont wanna let you down But only I can save me!  Been searching somewhere out there For whats been missing right here
Sad,A long December and theres reason to believe Maybe this year will be better than the last I cant remember the last thing that you said as you were leavin Now the days go by so fast And its one more day up in the canyons And its one more night in Hollywood If you think that I could be forgiven...I wish you would The smell of hospitals in winter And the feeling that its all a lot of oysters but no pearls All at once you look across a crowded room To see the way that light attaches to a girl And its one more day up in the canyons And its one more night in Hollywood If you think you might come to California...I think you should Drove up to Hillside Manor sometime after two a.m. And talked a little while about the year I guess the winter makes you laugh a little slower Makes you talk a little lower about the things you could not show her And its been a long December and theres reason to believe Maybe this year will be better than the last I cant remember all the times I tried to tell my myself To hold on to these moments as they pass And its one more day up in the canyon And its one more night in Hollywood Its been so long since Ive seen the ocean...I guess I should
Sad,I am the only one to blame for this Somehow it all ends up the same Soaring on the wings of selfish pride I flew too high and like Icarus I collide With a world I try so hard to leave behind To rid myself of all but love to give and die  To turn away and not become Another nail to pierce the skin of one who loves more deeply than the oceans more abundant than the tears Of a world embracing every heartache  Can I be the one to sacrifice Or grip the spear and watch the blood and water flow  To love you - take my world apart To need you - I am on my knees To love you - take my world apart To need you - broken on my knees  All said and done I stand alone Amongst remains of a life I should not own It takes all I am to believe In the mercy that covers me  Did you really have to die for me? All I am for all you are Because what I need and what I believe are worlds apart  [Additional lyrics:]  I look beyond the empty cross forgetting what my life has cost and wipe away the crimson stains and dull the nails that still remain More and more I need you now I owe you more each passing hour the battle between grace and pride I gave up not so long ago So steal my heart and take the pain and wash the feet and cleanse my pride take the selfish take the weak and all the things I cannot hide take the beauty take my tears the sin-soaked heart and make it yours take my world all apart take it now take it now and serve the ones that I despise speak the words I cant deny watch the world I used to love fall to dust and thrown away I look beyond the empty cross forgetting what my life has cost so wipe away the crimson stains and dull the nails that still remain so steal my heart and take the pain take the selfish take the weak and all the things I cannot hide take the beauty take my tears take my world apart take my world apart I pray I pray I pray take my world apart
Sad,I tried hard to make you want me But were not supposed to be And the truth will always haunt me Even though it set me free And my tears flow like the ocean As they floated in the breeze They were falling in slow motion And they brought me to my knees  Youre haunting me taunting me all in my brain Turn off the light and now all that remains Fills me with doubt And Im shouting your name out loud Why do you wanna put me through the pain? I get the feeling Ill never escape I cant hide away from the shame of you  Tears on the ground tears on my pillow You wont bring me down And Ill get over you These tears will get me through And Ill get over you  Ill get over you Ill get over you Ill get over you Ill get over you  When did you lose your emotion? When did you become so cruel?

Sad,You hid your skeletons when I had shown you mine You woke the devil that I thought youd left behind I saw the evidence the crimson soaking through Ten thousand promises ten thousand ways to lose  And you held it all But you were careless to let it fall You held it all And I was by your side  Powerless  I watched you fall apart and chased you to the end. Im left with emptiness that words cannot defend Youll never know what I became because of you Ten thousand promises ten thousand ways to lose  [2x] And you held it all But you were careless to let it fall You held it all And I was by your side  Powerless  Powerless [2x]

Sad,Am I the only one I know Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat? Shadows will scream that Im alone.  I-I-I Ive got a migraine And my pain will range from up down and sideways Thank God its Friday Cause Fridays will always be better than Sundays Cause Sundays are my suicide days I dont know why they always seem so dismal Thunderstorms clouds snow and a slight drizzle Whether its the weather or the letters by my bed Sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head Let it be said what the headache represents Its me defending in suspense Its me suspended in a defenseless test Being tested by a ruthless examinant Thats represented best by my depressing thoughts I do not have writers block My writer just hates the clock It will not let me sleep I guess Ill sleep when Im dead And sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head.  Am I the only one I know Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat? Shadows will scream that Im alone But I know weve made it this far kid. Yeah yeah yeah  I am not as fine as I seem pardon Me for yelling Im telling you green gardens Are not whats growing in my psyche its a different me A difficult beast feasting on burnt-down trees Freeze frame please let me paint a mental picture portrait Something you wont forget its all about my forehead And how it is a door that holds back contents That make Pandoras Boxs contents look non-violent Behind my eyelids are islands of violence My minds ship-wrecked This is the only land my mind could find I did not know it was such a violent island Full of tidal waves suicidal crazed lions Theyre trying to eat me blood running down their chin And I know that I can fight or I can let the lion win I begin to assemble what weapons I can find Cause sometimes to stay alive you gotta kill your mind.  Am I the only one I know Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat? Shadows will scream that Im alone But I know weve made it this far kid. Ah yeah Yeah yeah yeah Oh oh Yeah yeah yeah  And I will say that we should take a day to break away From all the pain our brain has made The game is not played alone. And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it And keep it frozen and know that Life has a hopeful undertone.

Sad,I tried to be perfect But nothing was worth it I don’t believe it makes me real I thought it’d be easy But no one believes me I meant all the things I said  If you believe it’s in my soul I’d say all the words that I know Just to see if it would show That I’m trying to let you know That I’m better off on my own  This place is so empty My thoughts are so tempting I don’t know how it got so bad Sometimes it’s so crazy That nothing can save me But it’s the only thing that I have  If you believe it’s in my soul I’d say all the words that I know Just to see if it would show That I’m trying to let you know That I’m better off on my own  On my own  I tried to be perfect It just wasn’t worth it Nothing could ever be so wrong It’s hard to believe me It never gets easy I guess I knew that all along  If you believe it’s in my soul I’d say all the words that I know Just to see if it would show That I’m trying to let you know That I’m better off on my own

Sad,Oh... Remember... Oh I remember... I wanna know...  Where were you when I said I loved you? And where were you when I cried at night? Waiting up couldnt sleep without you. Thinking of all the times we shared.  [Chorus:] I remember when my heart broke. I remember when I gave up loving you. My heart couldnt take no more of you. I was sad and lonely. I remember when I walked out. I remember when I screamed I hated you. But somehow deep inside still loving you. Sad and lonely.  No one knew all the pain I went through. All the love I saved deep in my heart for you. Didnt know where I would go where I would be. But you made me leave. And plus my heart it just it just kept telling me so.    [Bridge:] There was nowhere else to go oh. Nobody else to turn to no. For the rest of my life I promised myself I will love me first genuinely.    I remember when I walked out. I remember when I gave up loving you. My heart couldnt take no more of you. So sad and lonely hey. I remember when I stormed out. I remember when I gave up loving you. I was sad and lonely.

Sad,Step one you say We need to talk. He walks you say Sit down. Its just a talk. He smiles politely back at you You stare politely right on through Some sort of window to your right As he goes left and you stay right Between the lines of fear and blame You begin to wonder why you came  Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend Somewhere along in the bitterness And I would have stayed up with you all night Had I known how to save a life  Let him know that you know best Cause after all you do know best Try to slip past his defense Without granting innocence Lay down a list of what is wrong The things youve told him all along Pray to God he hears you And I pray to God he hears you  And where did I go wrong? I lost a friend Somewhere along in the bitterness And I would have stayed up with you all night Had I known how to save a life  As he begins to raise his voice You lower yours and grant him one last choice Drive until you lose the road Or break with the ones youve followed He will do one of two things He will admit to everything Or hell say hes just not the same And youll begin to wonder why you came  Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend Somewhere along in the bitterness And I would have stayed up with you all night Had I known how to save a life  Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend Somewhere along in the bitterness And I would have stayed up with you all night Had I known how to save a life  How to save a life  How to save a life  Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend Somewhere along in the bitterness And I would have stayed up with you all night Had I known how to save a life  Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend Somewhere along in the bitterness And I would have stayed up with you all night Had I known how to save a life How to save a life  How to save a life

Offered up my shoulder just for you to cry upon Gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm They gave me the heartache and in return I gave a song It goes on and on  Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels I drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf no farewell So before I save someone else Ive got to save myself  I gave you all my energy and I took away your pain Cause human beings are destined to radiate or drain What line do we stand upon cause from here it looks the same? And only scars remain  Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels I drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf no farewell So before I save someone else Ive got to save myself  But if I dont then Ill go back to where Im rescuing a stranger Just because they needed saving just like that Oh Im here again between the devil and the danger But I guess its just my nature My dad was wrong cause Im not like my mum Cause shed just smile and Im complaining in a song but it helps So before I save someone else Ive got to save myself  Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels Or drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf no farewell So before I save someone else Ive got to save myself And before I blame someone else Ive got to save myself And before I love someone else Ive got to love myself

Cause I cant see forgiveness and you cant see the crime And we both keep on waiting for what we left behind.

As if this happening wasnt enough I got to go and write a song just to remind myself how bad it sucked. Ignore the sun the covers over my head. I wrote a message on my pillow that says Jesse stay asleep in bed. So dont apologize. I hope you choke and die. Search your cell for something with which to hang yourself. They say you need to pray if you want to go to heaven but they dont tell you what to say when your whole life has gone to hell.  Everyones caught on to everything you do Everyones caught on to And everyones caught on to everything you do (And I cant let you let me down again.)
