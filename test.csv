Happy,If you love somebody Better tell them why theyre here cause They just may run away from you Youll never know what went well Then again it just depends on How long of time is left for you Ive had the highest mountains Ive had the deepest rivers You can have it all but not til you move it Now take it in but dont look down Cause Im on top of the world ey Im on top of the world ey Waiting on this for a while now Paying my dues to the dirt Ive been waiting to smile ey Been holding it in for a while ey Take it with me if I can Been dreaming of this since a child Im on top of the world Ive tried to cut these corners Try to take the easy way out I kept on falling short of something I coulda gave up then but Then again I couldnt have cause Ive traveled all this way for something Now take it in but dont look down Cause Im on top of the world ey Im on top of the world ey Waiting on this for a while now Paying my dues to the dirt Ive been waiting to smile ey Been holding it in for a while ey Take it with me if I can Been dreaming of this since a child Im on top of the world Cause Im on top of the world ey Im on top of the world ey Waiting on this for a while now Paying my dues to the dirt Ive been waiting to smile ey Been holding it in for a while ey Take it with me if I can Been dreaming of this since a child And I know its hard when youre falling down And its a long way up when you hit the ground Get up now get up get up now And I know its hard when youre falling down And its a long way up when you hit the ground Get up now get up get up now Cause Im on top of the world ey Im on top of the world ey Waiting on this for a while now Paying my dues to the dirt Ive been waiting to smile ey Been holding it in for a while ey Take it with me if I can Been dreaming of this since a child Im on top of the world

Sad,See I cant wake up Im living a nightmare That keeps playing over again Locked in a room so hung up on you And youre cool with just being friends Left on the sidelines Stuck at a red light Waiting for my time And I cant see Why dont you love me Touch me tell me Im your everything The air you breathe And why dont you love me baby Open up your heart tonight cause I could be all that you need Why dont you love me Why dont you love me See Im just too scared to tell you the truth Cause my heart ache cant take anymore Broken and bruised longing for you And I dont know what Im waiting for Left on the sidelines Stuck at a red light Waiting for my time So just tell me Why dont you love me Touch me tell me Im your everything The air you breathe And why dont you love me baby Open up your heart tonight I could be all that you need Why dont you love me Why dont you love me Why dont you give me a reason Please tell me the truth You know that Ill keep believing Till Im with you Why dont you love me Kiss me I could feel your heart tonight Its killing me so Why dont you love me Touch me tell me Im your everything The air you breathe And why dont you love me baby Open up your heart tonight I could be all that you need Why dont you love me Why dont you love me Why dont you love me 
Sad,All I hear is raindrops Falling on the rooftop Oh baby tell me whyd you have to go Cause this pain I feel It wont go away And today Im officially missing you I thought that from this heartache I could escape But I fronted long enough to know There aint no way And today Im officially missing you Oh cant nobody do it like you Said every little thing you do Hey baby say it stays on my mind And I Im officially All I do is lay around Two ears full tears From looking at your face on the wall Just a week ago you were my baby Now I dont even know you at all I dont know you at all Well I wish that you would call me right now So that I could get through to you somehow But I guess its safe to say baby safe to say That Im officially missing you Oh cant nobody do it like you Said every little thing you do Hey baby say it stays on my mind And I Im officially Well I thought I could just get over you baby But I see thats something I just cant do From the way you would hold me To the sweet things you told me I just cant find a way To let go of you It official You know that Im missing you Yeah yes All I hear is raindrops And Im officially missing you 
Sad,Its raining its pouring A black sky is falling Its cold tonight You gave me your answer Goodbye Now Im all on my own tonight And when the big wheel starts to spin You can never know the odds If you dont play youll never win We were in heaven you and I When I lay with you and close my eyes Our fingers touch the sky Im sorry baby You were the sun and moon to me Ill never get over you youll never get over me Im sorry baby You were the sun and moon to me Ill never get over you youll never get over me And when the big wheel starts to spin You can never know the odds If you dont play youll never win We were in heaven you and I When I lay with you and close my eyes Our fingers touch the sky (Im sorry baby You were the sun and moon to me Ill never get over you youll never get over me) (Im sorry baby You were the sun and moon to me Ill never get over you youll never get over me) 
Sad,Catch a star as it falls and hold it in your hand Feel the heat still it burns searing embers of your glorious sun Oh this is painful this endless aching need The very thing I long for is what brings me to my knees  You walked in to my world won me over caught me so off guard But I gave in to the wonder to the poetry of our souls set fire And oh it was beautiful our tender hearts entwined And I thought we could conquer any mountains we would climb  And now I’m waiting on the light To ease the fury of this one desire I’m trying to be patient I’m trying to stay high I’m trying to find the wisdom in this long goodbye  Stop the world stop the noise I’ve heard enough my head is spinning ‘round Give me more than words to feed me truth I can believe in give me solid ground But our days are measured in fraying threads of gold Every day unraveling till there’s nothing left to hold  Now I’m still waiting on the light To ease the fury of this losing fight I’m trying to forgive you to hold my head up high I’m trying to find the wisdom in this long goodbye  I gave my love gave it all but in the end it didn’t change a thing You can’t love a man out of his fate can’t tame a head and heart so out of sync But oh I am grateful this will not bring me down The tides are always gonna turn and come on back around 
Angry,Pick up the phone Please tell me you’re home The monsters are gone The wardrobe is closed Where’s my guitar They hate when I sing So fuck my guitar yeah Fuck everything  Mmmm mmmm ()  String’s on a twist My ass they can kiss They’re making me sick Just go suck my dick No singing past ten You can’t stay in your bed So fuck mom and dad I’m going real mad  Mmmm mmmm ()

Why am I always led astray? Its gonna get better better better Id always hear you say  Tell me I’m great again And I love you more Ride high fake confidence Right down to my core It’s dragging up like an airstrike raid All under my skin I wear a mask to cover myself In the shape of a grin And again and again you’re breaking me down Let me in let me in For the doctor is down  Why am I bitter bitter bitter? Why am I always let it stay? Its gonna get better better better Ive always heard you say 
Angry,Im in a bad mood Got an ache in my head You always knew me Im the one who gets out the books under the bed  Im feeling [?] My outlooks grey So I make sure everyone Joins me in another miserable day  Cause Im angry angry Im so irate Im angry angry I work myself into a terrible state  Im angry angry Down to my soul Im angry angry My blood is up and Im out of control  Friends all think that Im toad When they see me they cross the road Ill get even Ill get back Smile so sweet and then attack  Ill scream and shout On the phone all day Stamp my feet To get my way  Ill be obnoxious Rude and rough Then hide away Before they call call call  My bluff  My wife just left me Shes taken the kids How could a nice guy like me So quickly end up on the skids  Im feeling lonely And sorry for myself The worlds against me Its not my fault its everyone else  Im angry angry Im all fired up Im angry angry Sensitivitys high and Im ready to [?]  Im angry angry Im looking for a fight Im angry angry I got to be [?] I got to be right 
Angry,Angry words and empty silence You on your side me on mine Lying here in total darkness That old cold spot marks the line Weve turn our backs on each other Feels we wasted so much time I didnt mean to hurt you Somethings are better left unsaid I cant sleep I cant stop thinking Its going round-n-round my head If I only stopped to listen Wed be making love instead [SOLO] Angry words and empty silence You on your side me on mine Lying here in total darkness That old cold spot marks the line Why cant we atart all over and go back one step in time
